horses but also used as human food;

_tsarariya_, also a brown bean, sometimes mottled;

and _abakuru_ of =kwaruru=, _q.v._

The following saying is applied to the bean:—“_na gazawa garkuwar
maiḳi niḳa, ka ḳi fari uku, ka ḳi a gona, ka ḳi a tukunya,
ka ḳi a chiki_.” These are nicknames for the bean, which is both
an unprofitable crop and an inconvenient and coarse kind of food,
but the stranger goes home and describes them as novelties which he
has seen—the bane of the indolent who will not take the trouble to
grind it—in the field it occupies more space than its value—in
the pot it requires long cooking—in the stomach it disagrees.
